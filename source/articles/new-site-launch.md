It happened.  We have officially launched our new public web site.  

This is the single best place to find a leading technology expert and
when you do,  youâ€™ll know that they have a strong relationship with
Microsoft and the skills (and global reach) your project needs. 

Peruse. 

The site will serve as a hub for news involving or affecting RD
participants, Microsoft customers and the broad Microsoft community, as
well as providing a means of finding one of our global members and
learning more about them. 

This is v1 of our site and it only gets better from here. Soon we will
have more in-depth bio information on each of us and links to our blogs
and feeds. Check back soon and often.
