There’s a lot going on over at Microsoft these days. In addition to a
large corporate re-organization that is designed to better align all
teams around a core strategy (One Microsoft), Steve Ballmer announced
his retirement from the company. The general feeling within the RD
community is that 

1. the re-org makes sense given how the world works and how antiquated some of Microsoft’s org structures have been and 
2. Ballmer’s retirement is being handled with great tact and class. 

Many of us in the developer community are dependent on Microsoft’s future
success and as such we continue to make our voices heard within MS to
help the company maintain its place as a world-wide technology leader.
