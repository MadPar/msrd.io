The RD program has been around since 1993 and that’s as long as the logo
has been in use.  But the world is different and so are we, damnit.  So
we have a new, cleaner, modern logo that reflects who we are and, more
to the point, how cool we are.  Look for our logo on our individual
pages and at technology events around the globe because there’s a good
chance one of us is there. 

The [RD Logo](logo.html) has vector art and PNGs of just
about any flavor you'd want.
