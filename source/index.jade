					:markdown
						We are community.

						Not only are we a close group of technology experts, we span the globe and
						spend an excessive amount of time authoring leading technology books, articles
						and blogs as well as speaking at events that range from the biggest conferences
						in the industry to local user group meetings. 

						We love what we do. 

						The RD program is exclusive.  Having been around since 1993, Regional Directors
						represent the best of the Microsoft Developer Community.  While we come
						together in a Microsoft program we work on all platforms and technologies.  We
						believe, however, in Microsoftâ€™s commitment to the developer community and we
						work directly with the company to help enhance their products and bring the
						market the best of technology innovation.
